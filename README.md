## Contributing
This project uses pre-commit to ensure code formatting is consistent before committing. The currently-used hooks are:

- black for *.py or *.ipynb files.
- prettier (with --prose-wrap always for markdown)

To set up the hooks on your local machine, install pre-commit, then run pre-commit install to install the formatters that will run before each commit.
